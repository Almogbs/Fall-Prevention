## Description
An IOT project to prevent patients (with temporary neurological disability) from falling out of bed in hospitals.
Using Machine Learning, we aim to predict whenever a patient is about to fall from his bed and give an appropriate warning to the medical staff.
A simple and smart UI will also be added to the system.
We use weight and pressure sensors to build our dataset and to collect data in real time.
